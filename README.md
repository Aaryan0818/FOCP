The "Portfolio" folder contains all the weekly tasks completed during the course. The "Project-chat" folder presents a system designed to assist prospective students by providing answers through an interactive online chat. The "Project-f1" folder includes a program that processes a timing system file to analyze and display the performance of current drivers.

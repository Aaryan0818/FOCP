''' 3. The Unixgrepcommand searches a file and outputsthe lines in the file that
 contain a certain pattern. Write an implementation of this. It will take two
 command-line arguments: the first is the string to look for, and the second is the
 file name. The output should be the lines in the file that contain the string.'''
